# Release notes for the sc software library

## General

 - We have been reminded, for good reason, to maintain release notes.
 - Please record explicitly if there have been any breaking changes wrt. the
   software API or ABI.  In this case, we'll bump the libtool version with
   the next release version.  Please also note if there have been A*I
   extensions, in which case we'll bump the libtool minor version.

## 2.8.6

There have been breaking changes, very strictly speaking.

### Documentation

- Begin maintaining a release notes file.
- Add to documentation of sc_containers.h.
- Completion and some polishing of the doxygen documentation in sc_io.h.
- Add the scda (file-oriented data format suitable for parallel,
  partition-independent disk I/O) API including its documentation in sc_scda.h.
- Restructure the I/O module in the doxygen documentation.

### Build system

 - No longer install getopt and puff original headers.
 - Make sc_getopt.h a purely internal header file.
 - Add a generic external library installation option.
 - Add script doc/p4est-build-wdeps.sh for autotools build.
 - Further align CMake with the autoconf build system.
 - Update CMake logic to configure zlib and jansson.
 - Add CMake option to run tests with Valgrind

### Functionality

 - Further align I/O wrappers with and without MPI I/O.
 - Simplify the replacements for MPI_{read,write}_at*.
 - Further updates to the MPI I/O wrapper code.
 - Deprecate the confiuration with MPI but without MPI I/O.
 - Add sc_io_source, sink_destroy_null functions.
 - Make sure not to sc_io_source_read an array beyond its length.
 - Add sc_io_file_load, save functions and test program.
