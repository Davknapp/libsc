# Release notes for the sc software library

## General

 - We have been reminded, for good reason, to maintain release notes.
 - Please record explicitly if there have been any breaking changes wrt. the
   software API or ABI.  In this case, we'll bump the libtool version with
   the next release version.  Please also note if there have been A*I
   extensions, in which case we'll bump the libtool minor version.

## 2.8.6

There have been breaking changes, very strictly speaking.

### Documentation

- Begin maintaining a release notes file.
- Completion and some polishing of the doxygen documentation in sc_io.h.
- Add the scda (file-oriented data format suitable for parallel,
  partition-independent disk I/O) API including its documentation in sc_scda.h.
- Restructure the I/O module in the doxygen documentation.

### Build system

 - No longer install getopt and puff original headers.
 - Further align CMake with the autoconf build system.
 - Add a generic external library installation option.
 - Update CMake logic to configure zlib and jansson.
 - Make sc_getopt.h a purely internal header file.
 - Add CMake option to run tests with Valgrind

### Functionality

 - Further align I/O wrappers with and without MPI I/O.
 - Simplify the replacements for MPI_{read,write}_at*.
 - Update zlib and base64 encode/compression routines.

## 2.8.5

This was the last version without a release notes file.
