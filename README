## CMake

For faster builds that work on Windows as well as MacOS and Linux,
that build quickly and are easily usable from other CMake projects, libsc
can be built directly, or used via FetchContent or ExternalProject from other
CMake projects.
With CMake, libsc works with compilers including GCC, Clang and Intel oneAPI.
Visual Studio does not currently work.

MPI is enabled by default:

```sh
cmake -B build
cmake --build build --parallel
```

To disable MPI:

```sh
cmake -B build -Dmpi=no
```

Optionally, run self-tests:

```sh
cd build
ctest
```

Optionally, install under directory set like `cmake -B build -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/local`

```sh
cmake --install build
```
