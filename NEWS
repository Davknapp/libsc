 * We begin introducing #define for backwards compatibility queries.
   These defines are placed in src/sc.h.
   Please see the paragraph COMPATIBLIITY below for a list.

COMPATIBILITY
=============

Compatibility #define variables in sc.h:

 * SC_INIT_COMM_CLEAN
   indicates that the communication is no longer modified in sc_init.
   The functionality is still there as an option; please see sc_mpi.h
   and look into the functions sc_mpi_comm_attach_node_comms and friends.
