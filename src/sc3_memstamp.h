/** \file sc3_memstamp.h \ingroup sc3
 * A data container to create memory items of the same size.
 * Allocations are bundled so it's fast for small memory sizes.
 * The items created will remain valid until the container is destroyed.
 * It is possible to return allocated items to the container for reuse.
 * 
 * The memstamp container stores any number of fixed-size items within a new
 * allocation, or stamp. If needed, memory is reallocated internally.
 *
 * We use standard `int` types for indexing.
 *
 * In the setup phase, we set the size of the element and stamp,
 * a number of items in stamp, an initzero property, and some more.
 *
 * An memstamp container can only be refd if it is setup.
 * Otherwise, the usual ref-, unref- and destroy semantics hold.
