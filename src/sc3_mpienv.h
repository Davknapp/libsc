/** \file sc3_mpienv.h \ingroup sc3
 * Create subcommunicators on shared memory nodes.
 *
 * This MPI environment structure is initialized from a main communicator,
 * usually \ref SC3_MPI_COMM_WORLD.  We derive one communicator for each shared
 * memory node by splitting the input communicator.
 * We share the node communicator sizes of all nodes and their offsets with
 * respect to the main communicator in an MPI 3 shared window.
 * In addition, we identify the first rank of each node communicator and create
 * one communicator over all of these first ranks, called the head communicator.
 *
 * When MPI shared windows are not supported or not enabled, we understand each
 * rank to be its own node, and the head communicator equals the main one.
 * The windows we allocate then use a non-MPI replacement, which can be faster.
